# Login Page

## Page Instruction 

**This is a page used for logining.**

It is necessary to say that you should put you logining logic code here. 
Although you have a component where users can fill their account and password, it is supposed to be only used for input and call the login function of this page when people want to login. (That's why the login-input component is not imported by vue-router)
